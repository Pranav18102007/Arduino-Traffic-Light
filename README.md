## Traffic Lights Controller (Arduino)

This project simulates a simplified traffic light system based on Arduino.
I built & tested it on a simulator (Tinkercad).

## Components:
-Arduino Uno
-3 LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red)
-220 ohms resistors
-Jumper wires + Breadboard

## How It Works
The LEDs cycle through (Green → Yellow → Red → Green) with delays.

## Simulation
-View it on Tinkercad(https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5uWz2svSTtK/editel?sharecode=N5F21Wx7RovixUlTQzzOBfC7OujlbTLQQGQ_DguMEEU)

## Code
See 'TrafficLights.ino' for full code.

## Circuit 
See 'Circuit.png' for the diagram.
